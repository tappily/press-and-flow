<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<h3>The Flight in the Heather: The Quarrel</h3>

<p>Alan and I were put across Loch Errocht under cloud of night, and went down its
    eastern shore to another hiding-place near the head of Loch Rannoch, whither we were
    led by one of the gillies from the Cage. This fellow carried all our luggage and Alan's
    great-coat in the bargain, trotting along under the burthen, far less than the half of
    which used to weigh me to the ground, like a stout hill pony with a feather; yet he was
    a man that, in plain contest, I could have broken on my knee.</p>

<p>Doubtless it was a great relief to walk disencumbered; and perhaps without that
    relief, and the consequent sense of liberty and lightness, I could not have walked at
    all. I was but new risen from a bed of sickness; and there was nothing in the state of
    our affairs to hearten me for much exertion; travelling, as we did, over the most
    dismal deserts in Scotland, under a cloudy heaven, and with divided hearts among the
    travellers.</p>

<p>For long, we said nothing; marching alongside or one behind the other, each with a
    set countenance: I, angry and proud, and drawing what strength I had from these two
    violent and sinful feelings; Alan angry and ashamed, ashamed that he had lost my money,
    angry that I should take it so ill.</p>

<p>The thought of a separation ran always the stronger in my mind; and the more I
    approved of it, the more ashamed I grew of my approval. It would be a fine, handsome,
    generous thing, indeed, for Alan to turn round and say to me: "Go, I am in the most
    danger, and my company only increases yours." But for me to turn to the friend who
    certainly loved me, and say to him: "You are in great danger, I am in but little; your
    friendship is a burden; go, take your risks and bear your hardships
    alone&mdash;&mdash;" no, that was impossible; and even to think of it privily to
    myself, made my cheeks to burn.</p>

<p>And yet Alan had behaved like a child, and (what is worse) a treacherous child.
    Wheedling my money from me while I lay half-conscious was scarce better than theft; and
    yet here he was trudging by my side, without a penny to his name, and by what I could
    see, quite blithe to sponge upon the money he had driven me to beg. True, I was ready
    to share it with him; but it made me rage to see him count upon my readiness.</p>

<p>These were the two things uppermost in my mind; and I could open my mouth upon
    neither without black ungenerosity. So I did the next worst, and said nothing, nor so
    much as looked once at my companion, save with the tail of my eye.</p>

<p>At last, upon the other side of Loch Errocht, going over a smooth, rushy place,
    where the walking was easy, he could bear it no longer, and came close to me.</p>

<p>"David," says he, "this is no way for two friends to take a small accident. I have
    to say that I'm sorry; and so that's said. And now if you have anything, ye'd better
    say it."</p>

<p>"O," says I, "I have nothing."</p>

<p>He seemed disconcerted; at which I was meanly pleased.</p>

<p>"No," said he, with rather a trembling voice, "but when I say I was to blame?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course, ye were to blame," said I, coolly; "and you will bear me out that I
    have never reproached you."</p>

<p>"Never," says he; "but ye ken very well that ye've done worse. Are we to part? Ye
    said so once before. Are ye to say it again? There's hills and heather enough between
    here and the two seas, David; and I will own I'm no very keen to stay where I'm no
    wanted."</p>

<p>This pierced me like a sword, and seemed to lay bare my private disloyalty.</p>

<p>"Alan Breck!" I cried; and then: "Do you think I am one to turn my back on you in
    your chief need? You dursn't say it to my face. My whole conduct's there to give the
    lie to it. It's true, I fell asleep upon the muir; but that was from weariness, and you
    do wrong to cast it up to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which is what I never did," said Alan.</p>

<p>"But aside from that," I continued, "what have I done that you should even me to
    dogs by such a supposition? I never yet failed a friend, and it's not likely I'll begin
    with you. There are things between us that I can never forget, even if you can."</p>

<p>"I will only say this to ye, David," said Alan, very quietly, "that I have long been
    owing ye my life, and now I owe ye money. Ye should try to make that burden light for
    me."</p>

<p>This ought to have touched me, and in a manner it did, but the wrong manner. I felt
    I was behaving badly; and was now not only angry with Alan, but angry with myself in
    the bargain; and it made me the more cruel.</p>

<p>"You asked me to speak," said I. "Well, then, I will. You own yourself that you have
    done me a disservice; I have had to swallow an affront: I have never reproached you, I
    never named the thing till you did. And now you blame me," cried I, "because I cannae
    laugh and sing as if I was glad to be affronted. The next thing will be that I'm to go
    down upon my knees and thank you for it! Ye should think more of others, Alan Breck. If
    ye thought more of others, ye would perhaps speak less about yourself; and when a
    friend that likes you very well has passed over an offence without a word, you would be
    blithe to let it lie, instead of making it a stick to break his back with. By your own
    way of it, it was you that was to blame; then it shouldnae be you to seek the
    quarrel."</p>

<p>"Aweel," said Alan, "say nae mair."</p>

<p>And we fell back into our former silence; and came to our journey's end, and supped,
    and lay down to sleep, without another word.</p>

<p>The gillie put us across Loch Rannoch in the dusk of the next day, and gave us his
    opinion as to our best route. This was to get us up at once into the tops of the
    mountains: to go round by a circuit, turning the heads of Glen Lyon, Glen Lochay, and
    Glen Dochart, and come down upon the lowlands by Kippen and the upper waters of the
    Forth. Alan was little pleased with a route which led us through the country of his
    blood-foes, the Glenorchy Campbells. He objected that by turning to the east, we should
    come almost at once among the Athole Stewarts, a race of his own name and lineage,
    although following a different chief, and come besides by a far easier and swifter way
    to the place whither we were bound. But the gillie, who was indeed the chief man of
    Cluny's scouts, had good reasons to give him on all hands, naming the force of troops
    in every district, and alleging finally (as well as I could understand) that we should
    nowhere be so little troubled as in a country of the Campbells.</p>

<p>Alan gave way at last, but with only half a heart. "It's one of the dowiest
    countries in Scotland," said he. "There's naething there that I ken, but heath, and
    crows, and Campbells. But I see that ye're a man of some penetration; and be it as ye
    please!"</p>

<p>We set forth accordingly by this itinerary; and for the best part of three nights
    travelled on eerie mountains and among the well-heads of wild rivers; often buried in
    mist, almost continually blown and rained upon, and not once cheered by any glimpse of
    sunshine. By day, we lay and slept in the drenching heather; by night, incessantly
    clambered upon break-neck hills and among rude crags. We often wandered; we were often
    so involved in fog, that we must lie quiet till it lightened. A fire was never to be
    thought of. Our only food was drammach and a portion of cold meat that we had carried
    from the Cage; and as for drink, Heaven knows we had no want of water.</p>

<p>This was a dreadful time, rendered the more dreadful by the gloom of the weather and
    the country. I was never warm; my teeth chattered in my head; I was troubled with a
    very sore throat, such as I had on the isle; I had a painful stitch in my side, which
    never left me; and when I slept in my wet bed, with the rain beating above and the mud
    oozing below me, it was to live over again in fancy the worst part of my
    adventures&mdash;to see the tower of Shaws lit by lightning, Ransome carried below on
    the men's backs, Shuan dying on the round-house floor, or Colin Campbell grasping at
    the bosom of his coat. From such broken slumbers, I would be aroused in the gloaming,
    to sit up in the same puddle where I had slept, and sup cold drammach; the rain driving
    sharp in my face or running down my back in icy trickles; the mist enfolding us like as
    in a gloomy chamber&mdash;or, perhaps, if the wind blew, falling suddenly apart and
    showing us the gulf of some dark valley where the streams were crying aloud.</p>

<p>The sound of an infinite number of rivers came up from all round. In this steady
    rain the springs of the mountain were broken up; every glen gushed water like a
    cistern; every stream was in high spate, and had filled and overflowed its channel.
    During our night tramps, it was solemn to hear the voice of them below in the valleys,
    now booming like thunder, now with an angry cry. I could well understand the story of
    the Water Kelpie, that demon of the streams, who is fabled to keep wailing and roaring
    at the ford until the coming of the doomed traveller. Alan I saw believed it, or half
    believed it; and when the cry of the river rose more than usually sharp, I was little
    surprised (though, of course, I would still be shocked) to see him cross himself in the
    manner of the Catholics.</p>

<p>During all these horrid wanderings we had no familiarity, scarcely even that of
    speech. The truth is that I was sickening for my grave, which is my best excuse. But
    besides that I was of an unforgiving disposition from my birth, slow to take offence,
    slower to forget it, and now incensed both against my companion and myself. For the
    best part of two days he was unweariedly kind; silent, indeed, but always ready to
    help, and always hoping (as I could very well see) that my displeasure would blow by.
    For the same length of time I stayed in myself, nursing my anger, roughly refusing his
    services, and passing him over with my eyes as if he had been a bush or a stone.</p>

<p>The second night, or rather the peep of the third day, found us upon a very open
    hill, so that we could not follow our usual plan and lie down immediately to eat and
    sleep. Before we had reached a place of shelter, the grey had come pretty clear, for
    though it still rained, the clouds ran higher; and Alan, looking in my face, showed
    some marks of concern.</p>

<p>"Ye had better let me take your pack," said he, for perhaps the ninth time since we
    had parted from the scout beside Loch Rannoch.</p>

<p>"I do very well, I thank you," said I, as cold as ice.</p>

<p>Alan flushed darkly. "I'll not offer it again," he said. "I'm not a patient man,
    David."</p>

<p>"I never said you were," said I, which was exactly the rude, silly speech of a boy
    of ten.</p>

<p>Alan made no answer at the time, but his conduct answered for him. Henceforth, it is
    to be thought, he quite forgave himself for the affair at Cluny's; cocked his hat
    again, walked jauntily, whistled airs, and looked at me upon one side with a provoking
    smile.</p>

<p>The third night we were to pass through the western end of the country of
    Balquhidder. It came clear and cold, with a touch in the air like frost, and a
    northerly wind that blew the clouds away and made the stars bright. The streams were
    full, of course, and still made a great noise among the hills; but I observed that Alan
    thought no more upon the Kelpie, and was in high good spirits. As for me, the change of
    weather came too late; I had lain in the mire so long that (as the Bible has it) my
    very clothes "abhorred me." I was dead weary, deadly sick and full of pains and
    shiverings; the chill of the wind went through me, and the sound of it confused my
    ears. In this poor state I had to bear from my companion something in the nature of a
    persecution. He spoke a good deal, and never without a taunt. "Whig" was the best name
    he had to give me. "Here," he would say, "here's a dub for ye to jump, my Whiggie! I
    ken you're a fine jumper!" And so on; all the time with a gibing voice and face.</p>

<p>I knew it was my own doing, and no one else's; but I was too miserable to repent. I
    felt I could drag myself but little farther; pretty soon, I must lie down and die on
    these wet mountains like a sheep or a fox, and my bones must whiten there like the
    bones of a beast. My head was light perhaps; but I began to love the prospect, I began
    to glory in the thought of such a death, alone in the desert, with the wild eagles
    besieging my last moments. Alan would repent then, I thought; he would remember, when I
    was dead, how much he owed me, and the remembrance would be torture. So I went like a
    sick, silly, and bad-hearted schoolboy, feeding my anger against a fellow-man, when I
    would have been better on my knees, crying on God for mercy. And at each of Alan's
    taunts, I hugged myself. "Ah!" thinks I to myself, "I have a better taunt in readiness;
    when I lie down and die, you will feel it like a buffet in your face; ah, what a
    revenge! ah, how you will regret your ingratitude and cruelty!"</p>

<p>All the while, I was growing worse and worse. Once I had fallen, my leg simply
    doubling under me, and this had struck Alan for the moment; but I was afoot so briskly,
    and set off again with such a natural manner, that he soon forgot the incident. Flushes
    of heat went over me, and then spasms of shuddering. The stitch in my side was hardly
    bearable. At last I began to feel that I could trail myself no farther: and with that,
    there came on me all at once the wish to have it out with Alan, let my anger blaze, and
    be done with my life in a more sudden manner. He had just called me "Whig." I
    stopped.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stewart," said I, in a voice that quivered like a fiddle-string, "you are older
    than I am, and should know your manners. Do you think it either very wise or very witty
    to cast my politics in my teeth? I thought, where folk differed, it was the part of
    gentlemen to differ civilly; and if I did not, I may tell you I could find a better
    taunt than some of yours."</p>

<p>Alan had stopped opposite to me, his hat cocked, his hands in his breeches pockets,
    his head a little on one side. He listened, smiling evilly, as I could see by the
    starlight; and when I had done he began to whistle a Jacobite air. It was the air made
    in mockery of General Cope's defeat at Preston Pans:</p>
  <pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye waukin' yet?
     And are your drums a-beatin' yet?"
</pre>

<p>And it came in my mind that Alan, on the day of that battle, had been engaged upon
    the royal side.</p>

<p>"Why do ye take that air, Mr. Stewart?" said I. "Is that to remind me you have been
    beaten on both sides?"</p>

<p>The air stopped on Alan's lips. "David!" said he.</p>

<p>"But it's time these manners ceased," I continued; "and I mean you shall henceforth
    speak civilly of my King and my good friends the Campbells."</p>

<p>"I am a Stewart&mdash;" began Alan.</p>

<p>"O!" says I, "I ken ye bear a king's name. But you are to remember, since I have
    been in the Highlands, I have seen a good many of those that bear it; and the best I
    can say of them is this, that they would be none the worse of washing."</p>

<p>"Do you know that you insult me?" said Alan, very low.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for that," said I, "for I am not done; and if you distaste the sermon, I
    doubt the pirliecue* will please you as little. You have been chased in the field by
    the grown men of my party; it seems a poor kind of pleasure to out-face a boy. Both the
    Campbells and the Whigs have beaten you; you have run before them like a hare. It
    behoves you to speak of them as of your betters."</p>
  <pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A second sermon.
</pre>

<p>Alan stood quite still, the tails of his great-coat clapping behind him in the
    wind.</p>

<p>"This is a pity," he said at last. "There are things said that cannot be passed
    over."</p>

<p>"I never asked you to," said I. "I am as ready as yourself."</p>

<p>"Ready?" said he.</p>

<p>"Ready," I repeated. "I am no blower and boaster like some that I could name. Come
    on!" And drawing my sword, I fell on guard as Alan himself had taught me.</p>

<p>"David!" he cried. "Are ye daft? I cannae draw upon ye, David. It's fair
    murder."</p>

<p>"That was your look-out when you insulted me," said I.</p>

<p>"It's the truth!" cried Alan, and he stood for a moment, wringing his mouth in his
    hand like a man in sore perplexity. "It's the bare truth," he said, and drew his sword.
    But before I could touch his blade with mine, he had thrown it from him and fallen to
    the ground. "Na, na," he kept saying, "na, na&mdash;I cannae, I cannae."</p>

<p>At this the last of my anger oozed all out of me; and I found myself only sick, and
    sorry, and blank, and wondering at myself. I would have given the world to take back
    what I had said; but a word once spoken, who can recapture it? I minded me of all
    Alan's kindness and courage in the past, how he had helped and cheered and borne with
    me in our evil days; and then recalled my own insults, and saw that I had lost for ever
    that doughty friend. At the same time, the sickness that hung upon me seemed to
    redouble, and the pang in my side was like a sword for sharpness. I thought I must have
    swooned where I stood.</p>

<p>This it was that gave me a thought. No apology could blot out what I had said; it
    was needless to think of one, none could cover the offence; but where an apology was
    vain, a mere cry for help might bring Alan back to my side. I put my pride away from
    me. "Alan!" I said; "if ye cannae help me, I must just die here."</p>

<p>He started up sitting, and looked at me.</p>

<p>"It's true," said I. "I'm by with it. O, let me get into the bield of a
    house&mdash;I'll can die there easier." I had no need to pretend; whether I chose or
    not, I spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart of stone.</p>

<p>"Can ye walk?" asked Alan.</p>

<p>"No," said I, "not without help. This last hour my legs have been fainting under me;
    I've a stitch in my side like a red-hot iron; I cannae breathe right. If I die, ye'll
    can forgive me, Alan? In my heart, I liked ye fine&mdash;even when I was the
    angriest."</p>

<p>"Wheesht, wheesht!" cried Alan. "Dinna say that! David man, ye ken&mdash;" He shut
    his mouth upon a sob. "Let me get my arm about ye," he continued; "that's the way! Now
    lean upon me hard. Gude kens where there's a house! We're in Balwhidder, too; there
    should be no want of houses, no, nor friends' houses here. Do ye gang easier so,
    Davie?"</p>

<p>"Ay," said I, "I can be doing this way;" and I pressed his arm with my hand.</p>

<p>Again he came near sobbing. "Davie," said he, "I'm no a right man at all; I have
    neither sense nor kindness; I could nae remember ye were just a bairn, I couldnae see
    ye were dying on your feet; Davie, ye'll have to try and forgive me."</p>

<p>"O man, let's say no more about it!" said I. "We're neither one of us to mend the
    other&mdash;that's the truth! We must just bear and forbear, man Alan. O, but my stitch
    is sore! Is there nae house?"</p>

<p>"I'll find a house to ye, David," he said, stoutly. "We'll follow down the burn,
    where there's bound to be houses. My poor man, will ye no be better on my back?"</p>

<p>"O, Alan," says I, "and me a good twelve inches taller?"</p>

<p>"Ye're no such a thing," cried Alan, with a start. "There may be a trifling matter
    of an inch or two; I'm no saying I'm just exactly what ye would call a tall man,
    whatever; and I dare say," he added, his voice tailing off in a laughable manner, "now
    when I come to think of it, I dare say ye'll be just about right. Ay, it'll be a foot,
    or near hand; or may be even mair!"</p>

<p>It was sweet and laughable to hear Alan eat his words up in the fear of some fresh
    quarrel. I could have laughed, had not my stitch caught me so hard; but if I had
    laughed, I think I must have wept too.</p>

<p>"Alan," cried I, "what makes ye so good to me? What makes ye care for such a
    thankless fellow?"</p>

<p>"'Deed, and I don't know" said Alan. "For just precisely what I thought I liked
    about ye, was that ye never quarrelled:&mdash;and now I like ye better!"</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<h3>In Balquhidder</h3>

<p>At the door of the first house we came to, Alan knocked, which was of no very safe
    enterprise in such a part of the Highlands as the Braes of Balquhidder. No great clan
    held rule there; it was filled and disputed by small septs, and broken remnants, and
    what they call "chiefless folk," driven into the wild country about the springs of
    Forth and Teith by the advance of the Campbells. Here were Stewarts and Maclarens,
    which came to the same thing, for the Maclarens followed Alan's chief in war, and made
    but one clan with Appin. Here, too, were many of that old, proscribed, nameless,
    red-handed clan of the Macgregors. They had always been ill-considered, and now worse
    than ever, having credit with no side or party in the whole country of Scotland. Their
    chief, Macgregor of Macgregor, was in exile; the more immediate leader of that part of
    them about Balquhidder, James More, Rob Roy's eldest son, lay waiting his trial in
    Edinburgh Castle; they were in ill-blood with Highlander and Lowlander, with the
    Grahames, the Maclarens, and the Stewarts; and Alan, who took up the quarrel of any
    friend, however distant, was extremely wishful to avoid them.</p>

<p>Chance served us very well; for it was a household of Maclarens that we found, where
    Alan was not only welcome for his name's sake but known by reputation. Here then I was
    got to bed without delay, and a doctor fetched, who found me in a sorry plight. But
    whether because he was a very good doctor, or I a very young, strong man, I lay
    bedridden for no more than a week, and before a month I was able to take the road again
    with a good heart.</p>

<p>All this time Alan would not leave me though I often pressed him, and indeed his
    foolhardiness in staying was a common subject of outcry with the two or three friends
    that were let into the secret. He hid by day in a hole of the braes under a little
    wood; and at night, when the coast was clear, would come into the house to visit me. I
    need not say if I was pleased to see him; Mrs. Maclaren, our hostess, thought nothing
    good enough for such a guest; and as Duncan Dhu (which was the name of our host) had a
    pair of pipes in his house, and was much of a lover of music, this time of my recovery
    was quite a festival, and we commonly turned night into day.</p>

<p>The soldiers let us be; although once a party of two companies and some dragoons
    went by in the bottom of the valley, where I could see them through the window as I lay
    in bed. What was much more astonishing, no magistrate came near me, and there was no
    question put of whence I came or whither I was going; and in that time of excitement, I
    was as free of all inquiry as though I had lain in a desert. Yet my presence was known
    before I left to all the people in Balquhidder and the adjacent parts; many coming
    about the house on visits and these (after the custom of the country) spreading the
    news among their neighbours. The bills, too, had now been printed. There was one pinned
    near the foot of my bed, where I could read my own not very flattering portrait and, in
    larger characters, the amount of the blood money that had been set upon my life. Duncan
    Dhu and the rest that knew that I had come there in Alan's company, could have
    entertained no doubt of who I was; and many others must have had their guess. For
    though I had changed my clothes, I could not change my age or person; and Lowland boys
    of eighteen were not so rife in these parts of the world, and above all about that
    time, that they could fail to put one thing with another, and connect me with the bill.
    So it was, at least. Other folk keep a secret among two or three near friends, and
    somehow it leaks out; but among these clansmen, it is told to a whole countryside, and
    they will keep it for a century.</p>

<p>There was but one thing happened worth narrating; and that is the visit I had of
    Robin Oig, one of the sons of the notorious Rob Roy. He was sought upon all sides on a
    charge of carrying a young woman from Balfron and marrying her (as was alleged) by
    force; yet he stepped about Balquhidder like a gentleman in his own walled policy. It
    was he who had shot James Maclaren at the plough stilts, a quarrel never satisfied; yet
    he walked into the house of his blood enemies as a rider* might into a public inn.*
    Commercial traveller. &lt;/&gt;</p>

<p>Duncan had time to pass me word of who it was; and we looked at one another in
    concern. You should understand, it was then close upon the time of Alan's coming; the
    two were little likely to agree; and yet if we sent word or sought to make a signal, it
    was sure to arouse suspicion in a man under so dark a cloud as the Macgregor.</p>

<p>He came in with a great show of civility, but like a man among inferiors; took off
    his bonnet to Mrs. Maclaren, but clapped it on his head again to speak to Duncan; and
    having thus set himself (as he would have thought) in a proper light, came to my
    bedside and bowed.</p>

<p>"I am given to know, sir," says he, "that your name is Balfour."</p>

<p>"They call me David Balfour," said I, "at your service."</p>

<p>"I would give ye my name in return, sir," he replied, "but it's one somewhat blown
    upon of late days; and it'll perhaps suffice if I tell ye that I am own brother to
    James More Drummond or Macgregor, of whom ye will scarce have failed to hear."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said I, a little alarmed; "nor yet of your father, Macgregor-Campbell."
    And I sat up and bowed in bed; for I thought best to compliment him, in case he was
    proud of having had an outlaw to his father.</p>

<p>He bowed in return. "But what I am come to say, sir," he went on, "is this. In the
    year '45, my brother raised a part of the 'Gregara' and marched six companies to strike
    a stroke for the good side; and the surgeon that marched with our clan and cured my
    brother's leg when it was broken in the brush at Preston Pans, was a gentleman of the
    same name precisely as yourself. He was brother to Balfour of Baith; and if you are in
    any reasonable degree of nearness one of that gentleman's kin, I have come to put
    myself and my people at your command."</p>

<p>You are to remember that I knew no more of my descent than any cadger's dog; my
    uncle, to be sure, had prated of some of our high connections, but nothing to the
    present purpose; and there was nothing left me but that bitter disgrace of owning that
    I could not tell.</p>

<p>Robin told me shortly he was sorry he had put himself about, turned his back upon me
    without a sign of salutation, and as he went towards the door, I could hear him telling
    Duncan that I was "only some kinless loon that didn't know his own father." Angry as I
    was at these words, and ashamed of my own ignorance, I could scarce keep from smiling
    that a man who was under the lash of the law (and was indeed hanged some three years
    later) should be so nice as to the descent of his acquaintances.</p>

<p>Just in the door, he met Alan coming in; and the two drew back and looked at each
    other like strange dogs. They were neither of them big men, but they seemed fairly to
    swell out with pride. Each wore a sword, and by a movement of his haunch, thrust clear
    the hilt of it, so that it might be the more readily grasped and the blade drawn.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stewart, I am thinking," says Robin.</p>

<p>"Troth, Mr. Macgregor, it's not a name to be ashamed of," answered Alan.</p>

<p>"I did not know ye were in my country, sir," says Robin.</p>

<p>"It sticks in my mind that I am in the country of my friends the Maclarens," says
    Alan.</p>

<p>"That's a kittle point," returned the other. "There may be two words to say to that.
    But I think I will have heard that you are a man of your sword?"</p>

<p>"Unless ye were born deaf, Mr. Macgregor, ye will have heard a good deal more than
    that," says Alan. "I am not the only man that can draw steel in Appin; and when my
    kinsman and captain, Ardshiel, had a talk with a gentleman of your name, not so many
    years back, I could never hear that the Macgregor had the best of it."</p>

<p>"Do ye mean my father, sir?" says Robin.</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldnae wonder," said Alan. "The gentleman I have in my mind had the
    ill-taste to clap Campbell to his name."</p>

<p>"My father was an old man," returned Robin.</p>

<p>"The match was unequal. You and me would make a better pair, sir."</p>

<p>"I was thinking that," said Alan.</p>

<p>I was half out of bed, and Duncan had been hanging at the elbow of these fighting
    cocks, ready to intervene upon the least occasion. But when that word was uttered, it
    was a case of now or never; and Duncan, with something of a white face to be sure,
    thrust himself between.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he, "I will have been thinking of a very different matter,
    whateffer. Here are my pipes, and here are you two gentlemen who are baith acclaimed
    pipers. It's an auld dispute which one of ye's the best. Here will be a braw chance to
    settle it."</p>

<p>"Why, sir," said Alan, still addressing Robin, from whom indeed he had not so much
    as shifted his eyes, nor yet Robin from him, "why, sir," says Alan, "I think I will
    have heard some sough* of the sort. Have ye music, as folk say? Are ye a bit of a
    piper?"</p>
  <pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Rumour.
</pre>

<p>"I can pipe like a Macrimmon!" cries Robin.</p>

<p>"And that is a very bold word," quoth Alan.</p>

<p>"I have made bolder words good before now," returned Robin, "and that against better
    adversaries."</p>

<p>"It is easy to try that," says Alan.</p>

<p>Duncan Dhu made haste to bring out the pair of pipes that was his principal
    possession, and to set before his guests a mutton-ham and a bottle of that drink which
    they call Athole brose, and which is made of old whiskey, strained honey and sweet
    cream, slowly beaten together in the right order and proportion. The two enemies were
    still on the very breach of a quarrel; but down they sat, one upon each side of the
    peat fire, with a mighty show of politeness. Maclaren pressed them to taste his
    mutton-ham and "the wife's brose," reminding them the wife was out of Athole and had a
    name far and wide for her skill in that confection. But Robin put aside these
    hospitalities as bad for the breath.</p>

<p>"I would have ye to remark, sir," said Alan, "that I havenae broken bread for near
    upon ten hours, which will be worse for the breath than any brose in Scotland."</p>

<p>"I will take no advantages, Mr. Stewart," replied Robin. "Eat and drink; I'll follow
    you."</p>

<p>Each ate a small portion of the ham and drank a glass of the brose to Mrs. Maclaren;
    and then after a great number of civilities, Robin took the pipes and played a little
    spring in a very ranting manner.</p>

<p>"Ay, ye can blow" said Alan; and taking the instrument from his rival, he first
    played the same spring in a manner identical with Robin's; and then wandered into
    variations, which, as he went on, he decorated with a perfect flight of grace-notes,
    such as pipers love, and call the "warblers."</p>

<p>I had been pleased with Robin's playing, Alan's ravished me.</p>

<p>"That's no very bad, Mr. Stewart," said the rival, "but ye show a poor device in
    your warblers."</p>

<p>"Me!" cried Alan, the blood starting to his face. "I give ye the lie."</p>

<p>"Do ye own yourself beaten at the pipes, then," said Robin, "that ye seek to change
    them for the sword?"</p>

<p>"And that's very well said, Mr. Macgregor," returned Alan; "and in the meantime"
    (laying a strong accent on the word) "I take back the lie. I appeal to Duncan."</p>

<p>"Indeed, ye need appeal to naebody," said Robin. "Ye're a far better judge than any
    Maclaren in Balquhidder: for it's a God's truth that you're a very creditable piper for
    a Stewart. Hand me the pipes." Alan did as he asked; and Robin proceeded to imitate and
    correct some part of Alan's variations, which it seemed that he remembered
    perfectly.</p>

<p>"Ay, ye have music," said Alan, gloomily.</p>

<p>"And now be the judge yourself, Mr. Stewart," said Robin; and taking up the
    variations from the beginning, he worked them throughout to so new a purpose, with such
    ingenuity and sentiment, and with so odd a fancy and so quick a knack in the
    grace-notes, that I was amazed to hear him.</p>

<p>As for Alan, his face grew dark and hot, and he sat and gnawed his fingers, like a
    man under some deep affront. "Enough!" he cried. "Ye can blow the pipes&mdash;make the
    most of that." And he made as if to rise.</p>

<p>But Robin only held out his hand as if to ask for silence, and struck into the slow
    measure of a pibroch. It was a fine piece of music in itself, and nobly played; but it
    seems, besides, it was a piece peculiar to the Appin Stewarts and a chief favourite
    with Alan. The first notes were scarce out, before there came a change in his face;
    when the time quickened, he seemed to grow restless in his seat; and long before that
    piece was at an end, the last signs of his anger died from him, and he had no thought
    but for the music.</p>

<p>"Robin Oig," he said, when it was done, "ye are a great piper. I am not fit to blow
    in the same kingdom with ye. Body of me! ye have mair music in your sporran than I have
    in my head! And though it still sticks in my mind that I could maybe show ye another of
    it with the cold steel, I warn ye beforehand&mdash;it'll no be fair! It would go
    against my heart to haggle a man that can blow the pipes as you can!"</p>

<p>Thereupon that quarrel was made up; all night long the brose was going and the pipes
    changing hands; and the day had come pretty bright, and the three men were none the
    better for what they had been taking, before Robin as much as thought upon the
    road.</p>
