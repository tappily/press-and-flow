            <p>The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the
            dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had
            occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that
            sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the
            proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands
            on a piece of waste. He was a blonde, spiritless man, anaemic, and
            faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his
            light blue eyes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-col grid-span-4">
            <div class="grid">
                <p class="grid-col grid-span-2">
                    "Hello, Wilson, old man," said Tom, slapping him jovially on the
                    shoulder. "How's business?"
                </p>
                <p class="grid-col grid-span-2 icon-wilson">
                    "I can't complain," answered Wilson unconvincingly. "When are you going
                    to sell me that car?"
                </p>
                <p class="grid-col grid-col-br grid-span-2">"Next week; I've got my man working on it now."</p>
                <p class="grid-col grid-span-2 icon-wilson">"Works pretty slow, don't he?"</p>
                <p class="grid-col grid-col-br grid-span-2">"No, he doesn't," said Tom coldly. "And if you feel that way about it,
                    maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else after all."</p>
                <p class="grid-col grid-span-2 icon-wilson">"I don't mean that," explained Wilson quickly. "I just meant----"</p>
            </div>
            <p>His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then
                I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a
                woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle
                thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously
                as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue
                crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an
                immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body
                were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and walking through her
                husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in
                the eye. Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her
                husband in a soft, coarse voice:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-col grid-span-4">
            <p>"Get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody can sit down."</p>

            <p>"Oh, sure," agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office,
            mingling immediately with the cement color of the walls. A white ashen
            dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in
            the vicinity--except his wife, who moved close to Tom.</p>
            <div class="grid">
                <p class="grid-col grid-span-2">
                "I want to see you," said Tom intently. "Get on the next train."
                </p>
                <div class="grid-col grid-span-2">
                    <p>
                        "All right."
                    </p>
                    <p>"I'll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level."</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson
            emerged with two chairs from his office door.</p>

            <p>We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before
            the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting
            torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.</p>
            <div class="grid">
                <p class="grid-col grid-span-2">"Terrible place, isn't it," said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor
                Eckleburg.</p>
                <p class="grid-col grid-span-2">"Awful."</p>
